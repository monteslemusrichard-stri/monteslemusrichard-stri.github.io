## Welcome! 

I’m Richie Montes Lemus.

An environmental data scientist who spends alot of time exploring how machine learning can revolutionize conservation efforts. I strive for a harmonious blend between technology and nature in everything I do!

I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a B.S. in Environmental Studies and am currently pursuing my Master’s in Environmental Data Science at UCSB’s Bren School.
